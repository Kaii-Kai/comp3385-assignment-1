	<h2>Kyra Lee</h2>
	<p>Hi, my name is Kyra Lee and I am a 19 year old student of The University Of The West Indies Five Islands Campus. 
	Currently, I'm studying Computer Science, in hopes that I can one day become a Cyber Security Analyst. 
	If I am not using my time to code new projects then you most likely would find me trying to cook new dishes or baking new treats </p>
